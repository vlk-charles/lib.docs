linux for ARM development boards

<h3>Welcome to the Armbian Documentation!</h3>

If you're **new to Armbian**, the [Getting Started](User-Guide_Getting-Started.md) section 
provides a tutorial for everything you need to get Armbian running,
and answers many Frequently Asked Questions.
It then continues on to more advanced topics.

If you **need help**, and have read through Getting Started, check out [Troubleshooting](User-Guide_Advanced-Features.md#how-to-troubleshoot).

If you still can't find what you need here, visit the [Armbian forum](http://forum.armbian.com/), where your input can help improve this documentation.

# Common features

- Based on Debian Wheezy, Jessie or Ubuntu Trusty, Xenial compiled from scratch.
- Install images are reduced to actual data size with small reserve.
- Root password is _1234_. You will be prompted to change this password and to create a normal user at first login.
- First boot takes longer (up to few minutes) than usual (20s) because it updates package list, regenerates SSH keys and expands partition to fit your SD card. It might reboot one time automatically.
- [Ready to compile external modules](User-Guide_Advanced-Features/#how-to-build-a-wireless-driver)
- Ethernet adapter with DHCP and SSH server ready on default port (22)
- Wireless adapter with DHCP ready if present but disabled (/etc/network/interfaces, WPA2: normal connect or AP mode)
- Desktop environment upgrade ready
- NAND, SATA, eMMC and USB install script is included (_nand-sata-install_).
- Serial console enabled
- Enabled automatic security update download for basic system and kernel. Upgrades are done via standard _apt-get upgrade_ method.
- Login script shows: board name with large text, distribution base, kernel version, system load, up time, memory usage, IP address, CPU temp, drive temp, ambient temp from Temper if exits, SD card usage, battery conditions and number of updates to install.

# Performance tweaks

- /tmp & /log = RAM, ramlog app saves logs to disk daily and on shut-down (Wheezy and Jessie w/o systemd)
- automatic I/O scheduler (check /etc/init.d/armhwinfo)
- journal data writeback enabled (/etc/fstab)
- commit=600 to flush data to the disk every 10 minutes (/etc/fstab)
- optimized CPU frequency scaling with interactive governor (/etc/init.d/cpufrequtils)
	- 480-1010Mhz @Allwinner A10/A20
	- 480-1260Mhz @Allwinner H3
	- 392-996Mhz @Freescale imx
	- 600-2000Mhz @Exynos & S905
- eth0 interrupts are using dedicated core (Allwinner-based boards)
